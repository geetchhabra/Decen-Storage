
Key Changes and Explanations:
ABI Import:

javascript
Copy code
import contractABI from './StoragePlatformABI.json' assert { type: "json" };
Ensure this matches the path and structure of your StoragePlatformABI.json file in the src directory.

ABI Structure: If the StoragePlatformABI.json contains additional metadata (e.g., contractName, networks), only use the abi field when initializing the contract:

javascript
Copy code
const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI.abi, contractAddress);
Private Key Security: Never expose your private key in production. Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive information.

Execution Path: Ensure testFile.txt exists at the specified path or adjust the path in:

javascript
Copy code
const filePath = path.resolve('./testFile.txt');
Deployment Address: Double-check the contract address (0x36C49eD13dfF1040d56ed4E98084275F6d319274) to ensure it matches the address from your Truffle deployment.
